Create parallel "Android Test" project to use instrumentation/etc. 

adb -e shell
# cd data/data 

sqlite3 [path to db]
select * from sqlite_master;
.tables
.schema
.header
etc

android update project
  change build.xml project name if different than Main activity
  ant install
  ant coverage (see group, it's there now, but still unsupported)
  
  android update project -p PATH 
  android update test-project -p PATH -m TEST_PROJ_PATH
  
  after doing so if build.properties tested.project.dir is set - tests can't compile, install fails?
  
  
can't do the market:// intent search thing from emulator (no market app)
some hacks to install market app there

also have to install zxing manually for emulator, of course

for standard junit tests in eclipse - edit run config, remove android api library, add jdk and junit 3
